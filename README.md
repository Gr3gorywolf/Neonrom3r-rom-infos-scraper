# Neonrom3r-rom-infos-scraper
A simple console application that scrap all the roms info the-eye.eu  and libretro-thumbnails and then generate a json containing the info of every rom 

This application is based on modified <a href="https://github.com/Gr3gorywolf/EmulatorGamesSuperscraper">Emulator.games scraper</a>  but this 
one is no 100% dependant of the webpage because once the data is extacted you just need to put that data in an http server to use it on your
app because the data is extracted in json format(that can be parsed with almost all the languajes)
